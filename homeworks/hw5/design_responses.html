                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>I learned about the different types of UI interactions. For example, there is a cascading effect for the "Selected Works Transitions Experiments". Also, I really like the "Dark" exhibit where there is an interactive element to the elements on the website.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>My favorite part is the style of the website. Specifically, I like how the writer organizes the exhibit to include multiple UI interfaces, from websites to phone apps. I also like how each exhibit takes a different approach in regards to the design, depending on the purpose of the website/app.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>My favorite inspirations were "Selected Works Transitions Experiments" by Zhenya Rynzhuk and "Dark" by BestServedBold. The "Selected Works" interface is very interactive and unique. The cascading boxes catch and maintain the user's attention. The "Dark" website aims to exhibit a dark, mysterious vibe that matches the show. The designer does this through their use of images, dark colors, and placement of each element (words behhind the character and the cave in fron of the character).</p>
