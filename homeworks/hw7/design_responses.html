						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is the gestalt principle. The multi-stability aspect is very interesting because it reminds me of those ambiguous images in which there are two images, but our brain recognizes one of the images at first. At the same time, other people will see the other image first.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of this article is the emphasis on the connection between visual design and psychology. It provides a starting point to look at the importance of psychology. For instance, understanding psychology can teach designers to create content that isn't discriminatory or prejudiced. For instance, the colors used and the way objects are spatially organized must be considered in context of how people all across the world access the Internet, like how in other parts of the world people use phone brands other than iPhone and Samsung.</p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"User Interface Design isn't all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It's mainly about communication, performance and convenience."
