            <li>Something I learned from this article is the importance of hierarchy, content, intent, and audience. Another thing that caught my attention was how we as users don't really notice the time and planning spent on app design.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this article is how the author provided GIFs and explanations. In doing so, I can see the thought process of how a product designer designs an app.</li>
            <li>"By routinely analyzing other apps, you'll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."</li>
