						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>I learned about the difference between bad designs and dark patterns. Bad designs are designs are made without ill intent. However, dark patterns are made on purpose to manipulate people for the benefit of the company. It's even more interesting to note how its caleld "dark patterns" and not "dark designs." </p>

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>My favorite part of this article is the darkpatterns.org. The author lists the purpose of the website: "the goal of naming and shaming deceptive user interfaces." I like how the website doesn't aim to just teach the public about dark patterns but also to embarrass the companies for money-making schemes. Considering how dark patterns are disguised as normal and that many people don't know about it (including me), it is important that such a repository exists.</p>
